For example, in this table, the value of GL_Account_Number [GlAcntNr] is 101, the value of GL_Account_Name [GlAcntNm] is cash, and the value of Balance_Debit_Or_Credit is D. If the value of GL_Account_Number [GlAcntNr] in GL_Tial_Balance table is 101, then the Amount corresponding with cash account (101) must be debit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>16</TD><TD><a href="#BasPayTerm">BAS PAYMENT TERM</a></TD><TD>Contains the details of the payment term, which is applied and referenced in the PUR and SAL modules. The payment term refers to the condition of a sale/purchase agreement and is related to how the customer will pay (type of credit instrument), and especially how much time is allowed for payment (credit period) and discount (cash discount and discount period).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>17</TD><TD><a href="#BasProj">BAS PROJECT</a></TD><TD>Contains the detailed information related to the project (e.g. construction project, government or business-funded research project). Projects are commonly administrated separately and could be subject to being audit in accordance with regulatory and/or managerial requirements. The audit of a project is a thorough examination of the management, execution, methodology, procedures, records, budgets, expenditures, and the degree of completion. It is referenced in several modules including GL, AR, AP and INV.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>18</TD><TD><a href="#BasBankAcnt">BAS BANK ACCOUNT</a></TD><TD>Contains the details of a bank account.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>20</TD><TD><a href="#BasTaxTyp">BAS TAX TYPE</a></TD><TD>Contains detailed information on tax types used by the business. The tables in AR, SAL, AP and PUR modules contain 4 tax types, which can meet the requirements in most cases of the business. Tax types could be tax in country level, state level, county level or in local level, or could be tax related to a transaction (e.g. sales tax, value added tax, tariff).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>21</TD><TD><a href="#BasCstmzdAccSg">BAS CUSTOMIZED ACC SEGMENT</a></TD><TD>An Account Segment is a customized file item, which includes the information of the customized account segments that are not fixed account segments and no other table contains their description information (e.g. region type). This table is used together with the BAS_Customized_ACC_Value [BasCstmzdAccValue].</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>22</TD><TD><a href="#BasCstmzdAccValue">BAS CUSTOMIZED ACC VALUE</a></TD><TD>Contains the information from the customized account segment value.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>23</TD><TD><a href="#BasProfile">BAS PROFILE</a></TD><TD>Contains industry and software version information. This table contains information related to the profile of the data being collected. For example, when we extract the financial data of 2016 from an auditee using SAP XXX ERP System in 2017.1.16, there should be a record with the Profile_Name [ProfileNm] "XXX_2016", Fiscal_Year [FiscYr] "2016", Developer_Name [DvlprNm] "SAP", Software_Name [SftwNm] "SAP_S/4", Software_Version [SftwVers] "2.0", Functional_Currency "CNY", Standard_Version [StdVers] "ISO 21378", Extracted_Date [ExtractedDt] "2017-01-16".</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>24</TD><TD><a href="#GlTrialBal">GL TRIAL BALANCE</a></TD><TD>Contains all the ledger account balance information of the ADCS. The GL_Trial_Balance [GlTrialBal] file shall contain the ending balances at a point in time. The GL_Trial_Balance [GlTrialBal] should be extracted at the same time as the GL_Details [GlDtls] to prevent differences in transactions and balances.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>25</TD><TD><a href="#GlDtls">GL DETAILS</a></TD><TD>Contains all of the journal entry details for each transaction (e.g. associated journal entry ID, associated account number, debits or credits associated with the journal entry line). This table should be at the journal entry line level.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>26</TD><TD><a href="#GlSrc">GL SOURCE</a></TD><TD>Contains additional information about the sources provided in the GL_Details [GlDtls] table. Each source shall include a description of the ERP system or accounting package, from which the data is extracted, and information related to the business process the data represents.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>27</TD><TD><a href="#GlAcntSg">GL ACCOUNT SEGMENT</a></TD><TD>Contains the code and name for the account segment, as well as the GL_Account_Number [GlAcntNr] to which the account segment is related. Account Segment provides additional information for particular GL_Accounts (e.g. the AR contains the information regarding supplier, customer, employee, and project). Such information would be treated as an Account Segment below A/R, thus resulting in a lengthy account structure. The Account Segment structure is therefore defined as a set to record related information, which efficiently stops account names and numbers from becoming too long and too complex. Account Segment is more flexible to capture the complicated information.Some of the most frequently used account segments (e.g. project, employee, bank account) are defined as fixed fields in tables, such as GL_Details [GlDtls]. These segments are called "fixed account segments" in the document. Fixed account segments and other customized account segments are covered in this table.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>28</TD><TD><a href="#GlAcntPerBal">GL ACCOUNT PERIOD BALANCE</a></TD><TD>Contains the cumulative total and balance of accounts in each accounting period, facilitating the calculation of beginning, ending balance, duration amounts and quantity, thus reflecting information and changes in GL more intuitively. In this table, the quantity can serve different regulatory and managerial purposes. For example, subledgers of inventory and PPE may not be covered in some auditees' systems. In this case, we can record the cumulative total and balance of quantity of inventory or PPE in this table. This is a well-established practice in some countries, like France and China. Countries can choose to use GL_Trial_Balance [GlTrialBal] or GL_Accounts_Period_Balance [GlAcntPerBal] or both, depending on their customary practice, regulatory and managerial requirements.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>29</TD><TD><a href="#ArOpnAcntRcvbl">AR OPEN ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE</a></TD><TD>Contains details regarding all open, unpaid or unresolved customer transactions as of a specified date. Each row in this table represents the balance expected from the customer for one uniquely identifiable transaction. This data should be at the summary level (by invoice), not at the detailed level (by invoice line item). The sum total of the transaction amounts as of the specified date shall reconcile to the total AR amount in the GL as of the same date.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>30</TD><TD><a href="#ArCashRcvd">AR CASH RECEIVED</a></TD><TD>Contains information on all payment transactions received during the period. Cash means any type of receipt received including checks, wire transfers and cash.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>31</TD><TD><a href="#ArCashApl">AR CASH APPLICATION</a></TD><TD>Contains information of all cash receipts applied against the invoice during the period under review. The file will record each application of cash receipt to an invoice. For example, if a cash receipt was applied to three invoices, there will be three records for that receipt, one for each of the invoices to which the cash was applied. In the context of this process, cash means any type of receipt received including checks and wire transfers and cash.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>32</TD><TD><a href="#ArAdj">AR ADJUSTMENT</a></TD><TD>Contains all adjustments recorded against the invoice and impacting the invoice balance during the period. (e.g. write-offs, credit memos, and other adjustments). The data set shall contain one record for each adjustment to each invoice. For example, if an adjustment transaction impacted three invoices, there shall be three records for that adjustment: one for each of the invoices impacted by the adjustment.</TD></TR>

Account Segment provides additional information for particular GL_Accounts (e.g. the AR contains the information regarding supplier, customer, employee, and project). Such information would be treated as an Account Segment below A/R, thus resulting in a lengthy account structure. The Account Segment structure is therefore defined as a set to record related information, which efficiently stops account names and numbers from becoming too long and too complex. Account Segment is more flexible to capture the complicated information.Some of the most frequently used account segments (e.g. project, employee, bank account) are defined as fixed fields in tables, such as GL_Details [GlDtls]. These segments are called "fixed account segments" in the document. Fixed account segments and other customized account segments are covered in this table.</TD></TR>
